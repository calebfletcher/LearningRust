# LearningRust

A collection of small projects used to teach myself Rust.

This repository is not intended to be an exhaustive tutorial, nor is it intended to be particularly guided to help you through learning Rust. This repository is intended to multiple small self-contained projects, written in Rust which I used as a way of learning Rust.
